==================================
Here are some tips for creating a successful data backup or disaster recovery plan:

* **Identify what data needs to be backed up.** Not all data is equally important, so it's important to prioritize which data needs to be backed up first. Make a list of the most critical data and make sure that this data is included in your backup plan.
* **Choose the right backup method.** There are many ways to back up data, so choosing the method best suits your needs are important. If you have large amounts of data to backup, you may want to consider using an online backup service.
* **Never ever** have the backup data on the same disk as the original data. If the disk fails everything is lost.
* **Store backups in a safe location.** Once you have made your backups, storing them in a safe and secure location is crucial. If you are using an external hard drive, make sure that it is stored in a fire-proof and water-proof safe.
* **Test your backups regularly.** It's important to test your backups regularly to ensure that they are working properly. Restore your backups to a test environment and check that all of your data can be accessed as expected.
* **Keep your backup plan up to date.** As your business grows and changes, so too should your backup plan. Review your backup plan regularly and ensure it is still meeting your needs.
